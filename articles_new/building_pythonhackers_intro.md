# Building Python Hackers

I am going to build [pythonhackers.com](http://pythonhackers.com) and I will write articles about it.
Setting up, deploy, coding, unit testing, process management, monitoring, databases, queues, statistics, log management, error handling, continuous integration, build server, and a lot more
about it.

I've done professional programming with multiple languages. After 7 years of .NET, 6 months of PHP, some lines of Java, in 2011 I've decided to learn Ruby and wrote a small project with it using Rails.

Then for my last startup, I've decided to go with the Python. Mostly because of the NLTK and the simplicity of the syntax. Tornado was
5 lines to start with.
Django was hugely popular ( like Rails ) so I give Python a try. Glad I did.

Today, I've been writing Python almost 1.5 years and I have really enjoyed it so far. There is a great ecosystem behind it. System admins, DevOps,
academia, big startups like [Disqus](http://disqus.com), [Dropbox](http://dropbox.com), [Chart.io](http://chart.io), [Quora](http://quora.com)

There is a great amount of documentation for almost any open source Python project.


## Why ?

I do have a deep passion about Python, and startups. I'm going to build a community of people who also loves Pythons.

## How ?

Plan, develop, build, deploy, get feedback, Plan .... You know where it's going.

I will use Python 2.7, Flask, PostgreSQL, Memcache as starters.

## What ?

- Discuss/vote open source projects
- Find fellow hackers on your area
- Share articles
- Share pycode
- Built awesome stuff together

This is what I want to build.


Here is the [Trello Board](https://trello.com/b/2oZYRze9/pythonhackers-com)


## Building website

[PythonHackers.com](http://pythonhackers.com) is already live. I've done a static simple web page. There is nothing faster than a static website.
And there is completely no need to do anything with Python + Flask.

I connected the twitter account, and also created a [Mail Chimp](http://mailchimp.com) list to early adaptors can
drop their email address to learn the status of the project on the upcoming weeks.
